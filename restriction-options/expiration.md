# Expiration

The expiration is used to define the date and time when the license expires.
After the expiration date, the license verification will fail (`EXPIRED`).

This date in the web interface is displayed in the timezone of the user that is
currently logged in (i.e. the date is always at 00:00 in the timezone of the
user).
