# IP limit

The IP limit is used to limit the number of IP addresses that can be used to
verify this license in a 12 hour period. Keep in mind that IP addresses can
change frequently, especially on mobile devices. This means that legitimate
users might be blocked from using your software if you set this limit too low.

We recommend to set the IP limit to at least 3-times the number of users you
expect to use the license in a 12 hour period.

This restriction should only be used when verifying licenses in the frontend.
